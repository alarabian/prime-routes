                A privacy policy is a legal document that discloses some or all
                of the ways a party gathers, uses, discloses and manages a
                customer s data. The exact contents of a privacy policy will
                depend upon the applicable law and may need to address the

                is no universal guidance for the content of specific privacy
                policies, a number of organizations provide example forms.
